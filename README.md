FlamEdgeViewer 
Project Description

FlamEdgeViewer is a lightweight desktop tool designed to display and analyze flame-graph–style performance data. The project focuses on providing a simple and clear way to visualize how functions or modules connect with each other during program execution.

The viewer helps users understand the flow of execution, identify heavy or frequently-used call paths, and inspect the relationship between different parts of a program. It is useful for debugging performance issues, studying code behavior, and analyzing call hierarchies.

Features:

Displays hierarchical call data in a flame-graph style.

Allows zooming and navigation through different levels of the graph.

Highlights important call paths and execution edges.

Supports importing profiling or call-graph data for visualization.

Clean project structure using C++ for processing and Java/Kotlin (Gradle) for the application layer.

Purpose

The main goal of this project is to offer a simple and efficient tool that helps developers and students understand program performance by visualizing function-to-function transitions. It focuses on clarity, usability, and lightweight design rather than complex advanced features.
